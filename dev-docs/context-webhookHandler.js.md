Summary:
This code file (webhookHandler.js) defines an Express router for handling incoming webhooks. It includes a function to verify the webhook's authenticity using a signature and implements a POST route to process incoming webhook requests.

Main objects/functions:

1. verifyWebhook(signature, timestamp, payload)
   - Verifies the authenticity of the incoming webhook
   - Returns a boolean indicating whether the webhook is valid

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const isValid = verifyWebhook(signature, timestamp, payload);
   ```

2. Express Router
   - Defines a POST route for handling incoming webhooks
   - Uses express.raw() middleware to parse raw JSON bodies
   - Verifies the webhook and processes it if valid

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   app.use('/webhook', router);
   ```

Note: There are no public methods or classes defined in this file. The router is exported and can be used in other parts of the application.
