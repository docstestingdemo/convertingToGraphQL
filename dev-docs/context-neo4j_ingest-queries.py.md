Summary:
This code file contains functions for interacting with a Neo4j graph database, focusing on adding and updating data related to Zoom meetings, users, and participants. The main functionality revolves around the `add_profile` function, which processes and stores Zoom meeting data in the Neo4j database.

Main function:

add_profile(data: ZoomModel)
- Adds or updates a user profile and associated meeting data in the Neo4j database
- Handles creation of User, Meeting, Participant, and Recording nodes
- Establishes relationships between these nodes

Code example:
```python
zoom_data = ZoomModel(...)  # Populate with Zoom meeting data
add_profile(zoom_data)
```

Helper function:

execute_query(query, params)
- Executes a Cypher query on the Neo4j database
- Handles database connection and query execution

Code example:
```python
query = "MATCH (n:User) RETURN n LIMIT 5"
params = {}
result = execute_query(query, params)
```

Note: The code file doesn't define a specific class or object, but rather provides standalone functions for database operations.
