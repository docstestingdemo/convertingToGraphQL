Summary:
This code file defines two Pydantic models: CustomAttribute and Profile. These models are used for data validation and serialization, likely for handling user profile information in a system that interacts with Neo4j database.

Main Code Objects:

1. CustomAttribute
   - Represents a custom attribute with key, name, and value
   - No methods, only attributes

2. Profile
   - Represents a user profile with various attributes
   - No methods, only attributes

Both classes use Pydantic's BaseModel and ConfigDict for configuration. The Profile class includes numerous fields for storing user information, such as personal details, account information, and system-related data.

Since these are Pydantic models, they don't have explicit methods. Instead, they provide built-in functionality for data validation, serialization, and deserialization. Some commonly used Pydantic methods that can be applied to these models include:

1. Model instantiation:
   ```python
   profile = Profile(id="123", first_name="John", last_name="Doe", ...)
   ```

2. Dictionary representation:
   ```python
   profile_dict = profile.model_dump()
   ```

3. JSON serialization:
   ```python
   profile_json = profile.model_dump_json()
   ```

4. Data validation:
   ```python
   try:
       Profile(invalid_data)
   except ValidationError as e:
       print(e)
   ```

5. Partial updates:
   ```python
   updated_profile = profile.model_copy(update={"first_name": "Jane"})
   ```

These models can be used to ensure data consistency and integrity when working with user profiles in the application.
